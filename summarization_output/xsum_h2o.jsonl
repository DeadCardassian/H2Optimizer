Workers at the charity claim investment in housing would be cheaper than jailing homeless repeat offenders. The Welsh Government said more people than ever were getting help to address housing problems. Changes to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation. Prison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered. However, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority. Andrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was \"chronic\". \"There's a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere,\" he said. \"It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months. \"When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice.\" Mr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem. \"The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds,\" he said. Official figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales. Marc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released. He said he would ask himself: \"Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\" \"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing.\" Marc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing. \"You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said. Tom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available. \"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision,\" he said. \"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't. \"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\" A Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence. It added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "There is a \"chronic\" need for more housing for prison leavers in Wales, according to a charity.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "A charity which helps ex-prisoners to find accommodation has said that investing in housing would be cheaper than jailing people.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["A", "\u0120charity", "\u0120which", "\u0120helps", "\u0120ex", "-pr", "ison", "ers", "\u0120to", "\u0120find", "\u0120accommodation", "\u0120has", "\u0120said", "\u0120that", "\u0120investing", "\u0120in", "\u0120housing", "\u0120would", "\u0120be", "\u0120cheaper", "\u0120than", "\u0120j", "ailing", "\u0120people", ".\u010a\u010a", "###", "\u0120", "201", "6", "-", "12", "-", "26", "\u010a\u010a", "####", "\u0120The", "\u0120Guardian", "\u010a\u010a", "\u00e2\u0122\u00a2", "\u0120The", "\u0120Guardian", ":", "\u0120The", "\u0120Guardian", "\u0120view", "\u0120on", "\u0120the", "\u0120EU", "\u0120referendum", ":", "\u0120Britain", "\u0120is", "\u0120better", "\u0120off", "\u0120in", "\u010a", "\u00e2\u0122\u00a2", "\u0120The", "\u0120Guardian", ":", "\u0120The", "\u0120Guardian", "\u0120view", "\u0120on"], "token_logprobs": [-0.3069605827331543, -0.006240761838853359, -1.312779426574707, -0.016665644943714142, -0.34950631856918335, -0.013174745254218578, 0.0, 0.0, -0.168648824095726, -0.0019365858752280474, -0.04053741693496704, -0.5686444044113159, -0.26696720719337463, -0.7173640727996826, -0.8384808301925659, -9.655486064730212e-05, -0.001495791831985116, -0.4027383327484131, -0.036975301802158356, -0.0001333863037871197, -0.00014304091746453196, -0.020210525020956993, 0.0, -0.2206934243440628, -0.13015983998775482, -0.016735516488552094, -0.10276930779218674, -0.9399197697639465, -0.11936689168214798, -0.16797716915607452, -0.6876959204673767, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -1.0248216390609741, -0.0847024917602539, -0.0065663764253258705, -0.6215012073516846, -0.003734520636498928, -0.31450074911117554, -0.20975862443447113, -0.37297067046165466, -0.002898422535508871, -0.48224347829818726, -0.2704818844795227, -0.009316776879131794, -2.396077979938127e-05, -5.960462772236497e-07, -0.0048353406600654125, -0.48468267917633057, -0.05241511017084122, -0.00026782741770148277, -0.35037070512771606, -0.47859278321266174, -0.2806840240955353, -0.06566815078258514, -0.0008779485360719264, -0.8095508813858032, -0.005747103597968817, -1.311301275563892e-06, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, -9.393251093570143e-05, -5.960462772236497e-07, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"A": -0.3069605827331543, "\u0120charity": -0.006240761838853359, "\u0120which": -1.312779426574707, "\u0120helps": -0.016665644943714142, "\u0120ex": -0.34950631856918335, "-pr": -0.013174745254218578, "ison": 0.0, "ers": 0.0, "\u0120to": -0.168648824095726, "\u0120find": -0.0019365858752280474, "\u0120accommodation": -0.04053741693496704, "\u0120has": -0.5686444044113159, "\u0120said": -0.26696720719337463, "\u0120that": -0.7173640727996826, "\u0120investing": -0.8384808301925659, "\u0120in": -0.0008779485360719264, "\u0120housing": -0.001495791831985116, "\u0120would": -0.4027383327484131, "\u0120be": -0.036975301802158356, "\u0120cheaper": -0.0001333863037871197, "\u0120than": -0.00014304091746453196, "\u0120j": -0.020210525020956993, "ailing": 0.0, "\u0120people": -0.2206934243440628, ".\u010a\u010a": -0.13015983998775482, "###": -0.016735516488552094, "\u0120": -0.10276930779218674, "201": -0.9399197697639465, "6": -0.11936689168214798, "-": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "12": -0.6876959204673767, "26": -1.0248216390609741, "\u010a\u010a": -0.31450074911117554, "####": -0.0065663764253258705, "\u0120The": -9.393251093570143e-05, "\u0120Guardian": -5.960462772236497e-07, "\u00e2\u0122\u00a2": -0.005747103597968817, ":": -3.576278118089249e-07, "\u0120view": 0.0, "\u0120on": 0.0, "\u0120the": -0.0048353406600654125, "\u0120EU": -0.48468267917633057, "\u0120referendum": -0.05241511017084122, "\u0120Britain": -0.35037070512771606, "\u0120is": -0.47859278321266174, "\u0120better": -0.2806840240955353, "\u0120off": -0.06566815078258514, "\u010a": -0.8095508813858032}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The four have been charged with hate crimes and aggravated kidnapping and battery, among other things. An online fundraiser for their victim has collected $51,000 (\u00c2\u00a342,500) so far. Denying the four suspects bail, Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked: \"Where was your sense of decency?\" Prosecutors told the court the beating started in a van and continued at a house, where the suspects allegedly forced the 18-year-old white victim, who suffers from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, to drink toilet water and kiss the floor. Police allege the van was earlier stolen by Mr Hill, who is also accused of demanding $300 from the victim's mother while they held him captive, according to the Chicago Tribune. The court was also told the suspects stuffed a sock into his mouth, taped his mouth shut and bound his hands with a belt. In a video made for Facebook Live which was watched millions of times, the assailants can be heard making derogatory statements against white people and Donald Trump.

The study, published in the journal Cell, says the diet reboots the body. Experts said the findings were \"potentially very exciting\" as they could become a new treatment for the disease. The experiments were on mice put on a modified form of the \"fasting-mimicking diet\". When people go on it they spend five days on a low calorie, low protein, low carbohydrate but high unsaturated-fat diet. It resembles a vegan diet with nuts and soups, but with around 800 to 1,100 calories a day. Then they have 25 days eating what they want - so overall it mimics periods of feast and famine. Previous research has suggested it can slow the pace of ageing. But animal experiments showed the diet regenerated a special type of cell in the pancreas called a beta cell. These are the cells that detect sugar in the blood and release the hormone insulin if it gets too high. Dr Valter Longo, from the University of Southern California, said: \"Our conclusion is that by pushing the mice into an extreme state and then bringing them back - by starving them and then feeding them again - the cells in the pancreas are triggered to use some kind of developmental reprogramming that rebuilds the part of the organ that's no longer functioning.\" There were benefits in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the mouse experiments. Type 1 is caused by the immune system destroying beta cells and type 2 is largely caused by lifestyle and the body no longer responding to insulin. Further tests on tissue samples from people with type 1 diabetes produced similar effects. Dr Longo said: \"Medically, these findings have the potential to be very important because we've shown - at least in mouse models - that you can use diet to reverse the symptoms of diabetes. \"Scientifically, the findings are perhaps even more important because we've shown that you can use diet to reprogram cells without having to make any genetic alterations.\" BBC reporter Peter Bowes took part in a separate trial with Dr Valter Longo. He said: \"During each five-day fasting cycle, when I ate about a quarter of the average person's diet, I lost between 2kg and 4kg (4.4-8.8lbs). \"But before the next cycle came round, 25 days of eating normally had returned me almost to my original weight. \"But not all consequences of the diet faded so quickly.\" His blood pressure was lower as was a hormone called IGF-1, which is linked to some cancers. He said: \"The very small meals I was given during the five-day fast were far from gourmet cooking, but I was glad to have something to eat\" Peter Bowes: Fasting for science Peter Bowes: Intermittent fasting and the good things it did to my body Separate trials of the diet in people have been shown to improve blood sugar levels. The latest findings help to explain why. However, Dr Longo said people should not rush off and crash diet. He told the BBC: \"It boils down to do not try this at home, this is so much more sophisticated than people realise.\" He said people could \"get into trouble\" with their health if it was done without medical guidance. Dr Emily Burns, research communications manager at Diabetes UK, said: \"This is potentially very exciting news, but we need to see if the results hold true in humans before we'll know more about what it means for people with diabetes. \"People with type-1 and type-2 diabetes would benefit immensely from treatments that can repair or regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\" Follow James on Twitter.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The pancreas can be triggered to regenerate itself through a type of fasting diet, say US researchers.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "A diet that mimics the effects of fasting can reverse the symptoms of diabetes in mice, a study suggests.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["A", "\u0120diet", "\u0120that", "\u0120mim", "ics", "\u0120the", "\u0120effects", "\u0120of", "\u0120fasting", "\u0120can", "\u0120reverse", "\u0120the", "\u0120symptoms", "\u0120of", "\u0120diabetes", "\u0120in", "\u0120mice", ",", "\u0120a", "\u0120study", "\u0120suggests", ".\u010a\u010a", "###", "\u0120", "4", ".", "6", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", "."], "token_logprobs": [-0.023966485634446144, -0.00932646170258522, -0.005775668192654848, -0.013337675482034683, 0.0, -0.24095793068408966, -0.0003054867556784302, 0.0, -3.397406908334233e-05, -0.8759110569953918, -0.20479753613471985, -0.262587308883667, -0.01956673339009285, 0.0, -0.010754719376564026, -0.5072909593582153, -0.0014093714999035, -0.03896067291498184, -0.8585390448570251, -0.00022098960471339524, -0.03091602958738804, -6.222531374078244e-05, -0.0030427132733166218, -0.2119513899087906, -0.796424925327301, -0.0005616756388917565, -0.7374985814094543, -0.006315749138593674, -0.8349924683570862, -0.04920102283358574, -0.7455905675888062, -0.0003002431185450405, -0.553890585899353, -4.362964682513848e-05, -0.635267972946167, -4.172316494077677e-06, -0.015642914921045303, -1.5497195136049413e-06, -0.0010353925172239542, -5.960462772236497e-07, -0.0002917817619163543, -3.576278118089249e-07, -7.390703103737906e-05, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -1.0251946150674485e-05, 0.0, -2.622600959512056e-06, 0.0, -8.344646857949556e-07, 0.0, -3.576278118089249e-07, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"A": -0.023966485634446144, "\u0120diet": -0.00932646170258522, "\u0120that": -0.005775668192654848, "\u0120mim": -0.013337675482034683, "ics": 0.0, "\u0120the": -0.262587308883667, "\u0120effects": -0.0003054867556784302, "\u0120of": 0.0, "\u0120fasting": -3.397406908334233e-05, "\u0120can": -0.8759110569953918, "\u0120reverse": -0.20479753613471985, "\u0120symptoms": -0.01956673339009285, "\u0120diabetes": -0.010754719376564026, "\u0120in": -0.5072909593582153, "\u0120mice": -0.0014093714999035, ",": -0.03896067291498184, "\u0120a": -0.8585390448570251, "\u0120study": -0.00022098960471339524, "\u0120suggests": -0.03091602958738804, ".\u010a\u010a": -6.222531374078244e-05, "###": -0.0030427132733166218, "\u0120": -0.2119513899087906, "4": -0.796424925327301, ".": 0.0, "6": -0.7374985814094543, "2": -1.1920928244535389e-07}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

These are two of the biggest firms in the lucrative international business of making spectacles. France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer. It is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is. \"The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,\" says Essilor. But there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry. Gordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: \"This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user. \"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them. \"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,\" Mr Ilett adds. If the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry. It will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica. One long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors. \"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues. In his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up. \"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds. Unless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by. But if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor. Just a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses. When it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market. For its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace. In 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses. The overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories. Market research firm GFK describes the optical industry as \"a complex and extremely competitive market-space\". Even so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (\u00c2\u00a312.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review. These are: An inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers. A Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal. \"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said. \"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added. The EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules. But the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution. \"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says. \"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\" If you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds. Of course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers. Opticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit. They also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising. But for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business. On worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros.

She is the latest high-profile cyclist to come forward after Jess Varnish, Nicole Cooke and Emma Pooley criticised the World Class programme. Houvenaghel told the BBC she felt \"vindicated\" by a leaked draft report detailing British Cycling's failures. The report said British Cycling \"sanitised\" its own investigation into claims former technical director Shane Sutton used sexist language towards Varnish, who went public last April about her treatment. British Cycling subsequently admitted it did not pay \"sufficient care and attention\" to the wellbeing of staff and athletes at the expense of winning medals, an approach Houvenaghel attested to in her BBC interview. Both Sutton and predecessor Sir Dave Brailsford have now left British Cycling. Houvenaghel, 42, spoke to BBC Sport during its State of Sport week, which on Thursday examines the issue of athlete welfare versus a win-at-all-costs culture. A government-commissioned review, headed by 11-time Paralympic champion Baroness Grey-Thompson, into safety and wellbeing in British sport, is due to be published imminently. It is expected to recommend significant reforms designed to improve the way athletes are treated by governing bodies. Houvenaghel claimed: British Cycling said it \"has acknowledged and takes very seriously previous cultural and governance failings in the World Class Programme\". It said it has accepted the draft report's findings and already put into a place a 39-point action plan to \"systematically address the cultural and behavioural shortcomings\". The statement added: \"Our new chair Jonathan Browning has apologised for instances where we have fallen short in our commitment to athlete welfare and has offered to meet with anyone who can help improve British Cycling.\" Who else has spoken out? Houvenaghel won silver in the individual pursuit at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and gold in the World Championship team pursuit in 2008, 2009 and 2011. She retired in 2014, aged 39, after withdrawing from the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow with a back injury. Houvenaghel was critical of both Sutton and her team-mates in the aftermath of the London 2012 Olympics, where she was left out of all three team pursuit races as Dani King, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell-Shand won gold in a world record time. Speaking to BBC Sport this week, the Northern Irish rider said that experience was \"very traumatic\" and she felt \"torment\" at having \"no explanation\" for her last-minute omission. At the time, Brailsford, then performance director, defended the selection saying they had to \"take the personal element out of it, and look at the data and be professional\". He added: \"I think when a team steps up and makes six world records on the trot and a gold medal, then I don't think you can argue with that.\" British Cycling reiterated that point on Thursday, adding it was \"proud to support Wendy in what was a wonderfully successful cycling career\" and she was \"part of a pioneering generation of riders who set new standards of excellence\", but was dropped in London 2012 \"based on her performance\". Other elite cyclists, including King and Roswell-Shand have praised the leadership at British Cycling. Asked whether she was simply not good enough for the 2012 team, Houvenaghel replied: \"It was definitely not about performance. I don't think the fastest team on the day were permitted to race. \"There are certain chosen riders on the team who will not have experienced the culture of fear and will not have been on the receiving end of that - the bullying, the harassment, being frozen out of opportunities. \"It was horrid - it was not the training environment I expected. There was no choice. If you rocked the boat, you were out. There was no alternative. \"Medals at any cost, that's how it was whenever I was there, certainly in 2012.\" Houvenaghel said she also witnessed the sexism that has been highlighted by other female riders, and also claims she was discriminated against because of her age. \"I can certainly relate to the bullying,\" she said. \"For me personally, I felt it was more ageism - being a little bit older than my team-mates, it didn't seem to be something that the staff necessarily wanted for our team in 2012. \"They didn't care about what happened to me afterwards. I never heard another thing from them. \"After six years of constantly medalling at World Cups, World Championships, nationals, both on the track and on the road, they discarded me in a very undignified way from the team, which I don't feel was right.\" Fourteen-time Paralympic gold medallist Dame Sarah Storey told BBC Sport that elite level sport in Britain is \"cut-throat\" but there are \"no excuses for crossing that line\" into bullying. Asked about the balance between winning and athlete welfare, the 39-year-old replied: \"It's a really difficult question because you have to be a human being, you have to allow for people to make mistakes. But the currency is race wins, the currency is gold medals. \"It's not an excuse but you have to have a thick skin in sport, you have to be able to take the rough with the smooth because of the racing that you go through. \"But there are no excuses for crossing that line, and if those lines have been crossed they will be found out and they'll be dealt with.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A \"medal at any cost\" approach created a \"culture of fear\" at British Cycling, says former rider Wendy Houvenaghel.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "Wendy Houvenaghel has accused British Cycling of \"ageism\" after being dropped from the team pursuit squad at the 2012 Olympics.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["W", "end", "y", "\u0120Hou", "ven", "agh", "el", "\u0120has", "\u0120accused", "\u0120British", "\u0120Cycling", "\u0120of", "\u0120\"", "age", "ism", "\"", "\u0120after", "\u0120being", "\u0120dropped", "\u0120from", "\u0120the", "\u0120team", "\u0120pursuit", "\u0120squad", "\u0120at", "\u0120the", "\u0120", "201", "2", "\u0120Olympics", ".\u010a\u010a", "###\u010a", "Article", ":", "\u0120The", "\u0120", "19", "-year", "-old", "\u0120was", "\u0120found", "\u0120guilty", "\u0120of", "\u0120the", "\u0120murder", "\u0120of", "\u0120", "16", "-year", "-old", "\u0120Jay", "\u0120Wh", "iston", "\u0120in", "\u0120W", "alth", "am", "st", "ow", ",", "\u0120east", "\u0120London", ",", "\u0120in"], "token_logprobs": [-0.7902505397796631, -0.0008398343343287706, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0005806190893054008, 0.0, -0.37318146228790283, -0.03084355778992176, -6.675497570540756e-05, 0.0, -8.702239938429557e-06, -0.15995991230010986, -0.47471314668655396, -0.0028748870827257633, -0.007273029536008835, -0.49355044960975647, -0.378824383020401, -0.416780561208725, -0.0021019524428993464, -0.000697965151630342, -0.37679818272590637, -0.01254818495362997, -0.0019804879557341337, -0.5074899196624756, -0.010169241577386856, -0.3023532032966614, 0.0, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.017440997064113617, -0.00038890427094884217, -0.25271016359329224, -2.4676019165781327e-05, 0.0, -0.11010783910751343, -0.012657072395086288, -2.4058754444122314, -1.1920928244535389e-07, 0.0, -0.6313462257385254, -0.37026163935661316, -0.13722972571849823, -0.000619696278590709, -0.6988443732261658, -0.12663747370243073, -3.6954811548639555e-06, -0.035507529973983765, -1.0640101432800293, -7.152555099310121e-07, 0.0, -0.6174960136413574, -0.8002818822860718, 0.0, -0.027117561548948288, -0.8098717331886292, -0.021617382764816284, 0.0, -0.0036140859592705965, 0.0, -0.01209084503352642, -0.01454582717269659, 0.0, -0.010901772417128086, -0.1618947982788086], "top_logprobs": [{"W": -0.7902505397796631, "end": -0.0008398343343287706, "y": 0.0, "\u0120Hou": 0.0, "ven": 0.0, "agh": -0.0005806190893054008, "el": 0.0, "\u0120has": -0.37318146228790283, "\u0120accused": -0.03084355778992176, "\u0120British": -6.675497570540756e-05, "\u0120Cycling": 0.0, "\u0120of": -3.6954811548639555e-06, "\u0120\"": -0.15995991230010986, "age": -0.47471314668655396, "ism": -0.0028748870827257633, "\"": -0.007273029536008835, "\u0120after": -0.49355044960975647, "\u0120being": -0.378824383020401, "\u0120dropped": -0.416780561208725, "\u0120from": -0.0021019524428993464, "\u0120the": -0.6988443732261658, "\u0120team": -0.37679818272590637, "\u0120pursuit": -0.01254818495362997, "\u0120squad": -0.0019804879557341337, "\u0120at": -0.5074899196624756, "\u0120": -0.035507529973983765, "201": 0.0, "2": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "\u0120Olympics": -0.017440997064113617, ".\u010a\u010a": -0.00038890427094884217, "###\u010a": -0.25271016359329224, "Article": -2.4676019165781327e-05, ":": 0.0, "\u0120The": -0.11010783910751343, "19": -2.4058754444122314, "-year": -7.152555099310121e-07, "-old": 0.0, "\u0120was": -0.6313462257385254, "\u0120found": -0.37026163935661316, "\u0120guilty": -0.13722972571849823, "\u0120murder": -0.12663747370243073, "16": -1.0640101432800293, "\u0120Jay": -0.6174960136413574, "\u0120Wh": -0.8002818822860718, "iston": 0.0, "\u0120in": -0.1618947982788086, "\u0120W": -0.8098717331886292, "alth": -0.021617382764816284, "am": 0.0, "st": -0.0036140859592705965, "ow": 0.0, ",": -0.010901772417128086, "\u0120east": -0.01454582717269659, "\u0120London": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life.

But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid $20,000 (\u00c2\u00a313,000) for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn't making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease. \"We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out,\" says Mr Badr. \"None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through.\" Three years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club. Mr Badr says it's still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers. And he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space. Mr Badr says: \"I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient. \"That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.\" Mr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US. An industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020. \"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,\" says Mr Badr. \"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.\" While the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age. \"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says. \"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.\" Mr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news. \"It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them,\" he says. \"There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.\" But clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person. \"A club really has three businesses going on,\" says Mr Rosenfield. \"It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge. \"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics. The middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.\" Top-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year. Steve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons. He describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring. And although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income. Mr Bryne says: \"Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at. \"If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500. \"And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.\" Mr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks. \"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh? \"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.\" While the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost. \"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,\" he says. \"It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it. \"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.\" But in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh. Back in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September. He says: \"We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club?

Forecasters had predicted a solar storm and good conditions for Aurora Borealis, and sightings of green, pink, purple, red and yellow lights were reported for several hours from about 20:00 GMT. Gavin Chambers, an RSPB warden, tweeted pictures of vivid green in the sky over Lake Vyrnwy in Powys, Wales, saying: \"Well worth getting back out of bed for!!\" Donna Butcher tweeted: \"Just been watching an amazing display of Aurora from Staveley, Cumbria.

Rescuers found Sophia and Poppy 200m from a dam on the family's property. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: Relieved that the giant telecoms company would not be broken up, they piled into the shares, sending them up 3% in early trading. BT dodged a bullet - and, as the chief executive of Ofcom, Sharon White, admitted, it was for prosaic reasons. She said complications with land deals and BT's giant pension scheme meant there were \"practical obstacles\" to a break-up that would delay the process several years. It's the pension scheme that probably most influenced Ofcom's thinking. BT's retirement scheme, inherited from its time as a state-owned utility, has assets of about \u00c2\u00a340bn and a deficit, on some measures, of about \u00c2\u00a310bn, even though BT has poured in billions of pounds in recent years to redress the gap. Senior sources at the company say that about 80% of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT's rivals would like to see spun off. Separating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won. Creating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband. BT's share price reaction might turn out to be overdone. Ms White plans to enforce the separation by introducing not only a new board to run Openreach, but also new articles of association that will give directors a duty to serve customers of the network as much as the company's owners. This holds out an obvious prospect of conflicts to come, and runs counter to the normal assumption that in private companies, the shareholder is king. It also carries an echo of the \"golden shares\" held by the government in Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, two companies judged important for the defence of the realm. In each case, the golden share is actually enshrined by specific articles of association that give directors and the government powers beyond those normally enjoyed by company boards. BT's chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said he thought he could reach a compromise with Ofcom, but admitted they would need to see the detail of the new articles.

The firm admitted a Health and Safety Executive (HSE) breach and was fined \u00c2\u00a37,500. It must also pay \u00c2\u00a31,120 costs. The hearing heard how the worker had to have the big toe on his left foot amputated and two other toes removed. He was in hospital for seven days but has since returned to work, the hearing heard.

Aurora Borealis occurs when electrically-charged particles from the sun enter the earth's atmosphere. Many people took to social media to share photographs of the dramatic show. Forecasters had predicted a solar storm and good conditions for Aurora Borealis, and sightings of green, pink, purple, red and yellow lights were reported for several hours from about 20:00 GMT. Gavin Chambers, an RSPB warden, tweeted pictures of vivid green in the sky over Lake Vyrnwy in Powys, Wales, saying: \"Well worth getting back out of bed for!!\" Donna Butcher tweeted: \"Just been watching an amazing display of Aurora from Staveley, Cumbria.

Sir Patrick presented the first edition of The Sky at Night on 24 April 1957. He became famous for his habit of wearing a monocle on screen, as well as his dishevelled and idiosyncratic persona. However, he was a celebrated and gifted astronomer and wrote dozens of books, with his research being used by the US and the Soviet Union in their space programmes.

The dog, a one-year-old Australian sheepdog named Poppy, went with her. Police confirmed that Poppy's barking alerted rescuers to the whereabouts of the pair after a seven-hour search. Rescuers found Sophia and Poppy 200m from a dam on the family's property. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: \"I'm really looking forward to it - the home of Scottish football,\" said Rodgers ahead of his maiden visit. \"I hear the pitch is good, a nice big pitch suits the speed in our team and our intensity. \"The technical area goes right out to the end of the pitch, but you might need a taxi to get back to your staff.\" This will be Rodgers' second taste of the Old Firm derby and his experience of the fixture got off to a great start with a 5-1 league victory at Celtic Park last month. \"It was a brilliant performance by the players in every aspect,\" he recalled. \"Obviously this one is on a neutral ground, but we'll be looking to have a similar performance. \"We'll be prepared and focused. We know it's going to be a tough game. We anticipated that the last time.\" Rodgers is also aware Celtic's visit to Hampden last season in the Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers ended in defeat. \"The last experience there wasn't so good for Celtic,\" he said. \"But it's a different team with a different mentality and we'll look to take that mentality into the game.\" Rodgers lost two semi-finals in his time at Liverpool and is aiming to make it third time lucky at the club he joined in the summer. \"You have to perform - that's what's important and if you get little bit of luck along the way then hopefully you'll get the result that you want.\" said the Northern Irishman. \"So, for us, it's really looking at our performance level, which in the main has been at a really high level. \"My focus is always on my own team and, if we impose our style of play, it can give a lot of problems to opponents.\" Unlike predecessor Ronny Deila, Rodgers would not be drawn on this semi-final being a step on the way to a potential domestic treble. \"It's very, very difficult to achieve,\" he said. \"There's been great managers here in the past that haven't achieved that. \"But it's the first competition where we've a chance to win a trophy and I've always said that it's a priority for us because it's the first one. \"Our idea was to qualify for the Champions League, which we did, to make a good start in the league, which

The cut in undergraduate places will come into effect from September 2015. Job losses will be among both academic and non-academic staff and Queen's says no compulsory redundancies should be required. There are currently around 17,000 full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students at the university, and around 3,800 staff. Queen's has a current intake of around 4,500 undergraduates per year. The university aims to reduce the number of student places by 1,010 over the next three years. The BBC understands that there are no immediate plans to close departments or courses, but that the cuts in funding may put some departments and courses at risk. The Education Minister Stephen Farry said he recognised that some students might now choose to study in other areas of the UK because of the cuts facing Northern Ireland's universities. \"Some people will now be forced to look to opportunities in other parts of Great Britain and may not return to our economy,\" he said. \"Defunding our investment in skills, particularly at a time when we're trying to grow the economy does not make a lot of sense. What's happening is we're going backwards. \"The loss of any place is damaging to our economy, all subjects teach our young people critical skills.\" Queen's vice-chancellor Patrick Johnston said the cuts had the potential to damage the reputation of the university. \"The potential negative impact, not just on the university but on the local economy is very significant,\" he said. \"It's the last thing we want to do, but we have to begin to focus on those areas where we can grow the organisation and develop it - it's clear we can no longer depend on the public purse to fund tuition. \"If we're not competitive we will not attract the best students, and we will not attract the best staff.\" Just under \u00a3100m, a third of the university's income, comes from the Northern Ireland Executive. DEL's budget was reduced by \u00a362m earlier this year, and its budget for higher education institutions fell from \u00a3203m to \u00a3186m, a reduction of 8.2%. Ulster University announced in February that it was dropping 53 courses. It will be cutting jobs and student places, but it has not yet revealed how many.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Queen's University Belfast is cutting 236 jobs and 290 student places due to a funding reduction.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "Queen's University Belfast is to cut undergraduate places by 20% over the next three years.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["Queen", "'s", "\u0120University", "\u0120Belfast", "\u0120is", "\u0120to", "\u0120cut", "\u0120undergraduate", "\u0120places", "\u0120by", "\u0120", "20", "%", "\u0120over", "\u0120the", "\u0120next", "\u0120three", "\u0120years", ".\u010a\u010a", "###", "\u0120", "2", ".", "1", ".", "2", ".", "4", ".", "4", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2", ".", "2"], "token_logprobs": [-0.002853609621524811, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, -0.09227214753627777, -0.18626174330711365, -0.03022485226392746, -0.028772957623004913, -0.16767771542072296, -0.017017534002661705, -0.6590549945831299, -0.0012713929172605276, -0.15058302879333496, -0.0004564673872664571, -0.9203172326087952, -0.006587219424545765, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.34545445442199707, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.012200606986880302, -0.006835174281150103, -0.04569850489497185, -1.0211093425750732, -0.000432278640801087, -0.9359109401702881, -0.00025042734341695905, -0.6524036526679993, -0.008688976056873798, -0.6310960054397583, -0.0004700509598478675, -0.6040898561477661, -4.815939246327616e-05, -0.6362196803092957, -2.264974000354414e-06, -0.7259466648101807, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.6042633652687073, 0.0, -0.048851992934942245, 0.0, -0.008778078481554985, 0.0, -0.004756089765578508, 0.0, -0.00406344560906291, 0.0, -0.0009345216676592827, 0.0, -0.00038366109947673976, 0.0, -0.0001821352052502334, 0.0, -8.439661905867979e-05, 0.0, -3.8742269680369645e-05, 0.0, -1.156323378381785e-05, 0.0, -5.125986263010418e-06, 0.0, -3.6954811548639555e-06, 0.0, -2.622600959512056e-06, 0.0, -2.0265558760002023e-06], "top_logprobs": [{"Queen": -0.002853609621524811, "'s": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "\u0120University": 0.0, "\u0120Belfast": -0.09227214753627777, "\u0120is": -0.18626174330711365, "\u0120to": -0.03022485226392746, "\u0120cut": -0.028772957623004913, "\u0120undergraduate": -0.16767771542072296, "\u0120places": -0.017017534002661705, "\u0120by": -0.6590549945831299, "\u0120": -0.04569850489497185, "20": -0.15058302879333496, "%": -0.0004564673872664571, "\u0120over": -0.9203172326087952, "\u0120the": -0.006587219424545765, "\u0120next": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "\u0120three": -0.34545445442199707, "\u0120years": -1.1920928244535389e-07, ".\u010a\u010a": -0.012200606986880302, "###": -0.006835174281150103, "2": -2.0265558760002023e-06, ".": 0.0, "1": -0.9359109401702881, "4": -0.6040898561477661}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Ten shadow ministers were among 47 Labour MPs who rejected party orders to back it last week. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said frontbenchers would have to quit if they defied the whip at the next vote. The draft legislation comes back to the Commons on Monday for three days of debate culminating in a vote on its third reading. Speaking on BBC's The Andrew Marr Show, Ms Thornberry rejected a suggestion the party was \"hopelessly divided\" on the issue. She said she understood colleagues not wanting to vote in favour of invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which begins the formal departure process, but said: \"We have said that we will not frustrate Brexit. We have got our instructions from the British people. We are democrats and the public have voted to leave the European Union.\" Labour will try to amend the draft legislation to secure what it calls a \"meaningful vote\" on the final deal struck between Theresa May and the EU, and to guarantee the status of EU nationals in the UK and Britons living elsewhere in Europe. Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis has said he will vote against the bill unless Labour's amendments are accepted, describing them as \"red lines\". Ms Thornberry declined to say whether they were non-negotiable red lines for her party, and denied it was \"illogical\" to demand amendments but still back the bill in the final vote if they are rejected. \"There will need to be back channels, private conversations. There are many conversations going on now,\" she said. \"We are speaking to government, we are speaking to Tory backbenchers and we are trying to get a compromise that will work.\" One of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's closest allies, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, missed Wednesday's vote, citing illness. Former Labour minister Caroline Flint criticised Ms Abbott, telling ITV's Peston on Sunday: \"We used to have man flu, we now have Brexit flu that Diane has created here\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it's about being part of a team. \"I think she holds one of the most important portfolios within a shadow cabinet. If she can't support the leader on this then she should go.\" But former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman defended Ms Abbott, pointing out she had earlier said on television she would back the bill so had \"already taken the flak on it\". Among the rebels in last week's second reading vote were 10 members of the front bench, who would ordinarily be expected to step down after defying leadership instructions to back the bill. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that changes to his shadow cabinet would be announced \"in the coming few days\". Asked if he should be lenient, he added: \"I'm a very lenient person.\" Speaking later, he said he expected Ms Abbott to vote with the party this week. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the shadow cabinet would decide how to approach Wednesday's third reading vote on the Brexit bill. He told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 live that if a three-line whip was again imposed, any frontbenchers who rebelled \"will have to step down\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The shadow foreign secretary has suggested Labour will continue to support legislation paving the way for Brexit as it passes through Parliament.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "Labour has said it will not \"frustrate Brexit\" and will not try to block the bill implementing the UK's withdrawal from the EU.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["Labour", "\u0120has", "\u0120said", "\u0120it", "\u0120will", "\u0120not", "\u0120\"", "fr", "ustr", "ate", "\u0120Brexit", "\"", "\u0120and", "\u0120will", "\u0120not", "\u0120try", "\u0120to", "\u0120block", "\u0120the", "\u0120bill", "\u0120implementing", "\u0120the", "\u0120UK", "'s", "\u0120withdrawal", "\u0120from", "\u0120the", "\u0120EU", ".\u010a\u010a", "###", "\u0120", "2", ".", "4", ".", "3", ".", "2", ".", "3", ".", "3", ".", "5", ".", "2", ".", "3", ".", "2", ".", "3", ".", "3", ".", "5", ".", "2", ".", "3", ".", "2", ".", "3"], "token_logprobs": [-0.004295527469366789, -0.37884804606437683, -0.001688008545897901, -0.00016199229867197573, -0.00024089295766316354, -0.030186105519533157, -0.3767099678516388, -7.152555099310121e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.3198543190956116, -0.003418318461626768, -0.4754377603530884, -0.006709428504109383, -0.26967597007751465, -1.0345968008041382, -1.5497195136049413e-06, -0.05750978738069534, -0.0007111880695447326, -0.2647852897644043, -0.5964427590370178, -0.006899580359458923, -0.02762061357498169, -1.1920922133867862e-06, -0.6909729242324829, -2.3841855067985307e-07, 0.0, -0.17300714552402496, -0.0022527810651808977, -0.5551609396934509, -0.07289950549602509, -0.7020331621170044, -0.0006090931710787117, -1.0403703451156616, -0.0002924968139268458, -0.7228930592536926, -0.015673544257879257, -0.7445437908172607, -0.0001234931987710297, -0.6066351532936096, -0.0002611534437164664, -0.792234480381012, -3.1709168979432434e-05, -0.6691725850105286, -7.152531907195225e-06, -1.2512342929840088, -4.768370445162873e-07, -0.5353515148162842, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.648792564868927, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.0017072877380996943, 0.0, -0.6093351244926453, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.34126415848731995, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.11753229051828384, 0.0, -4.935142715112306e-05, 0.0, -0.000528076896443963, 0.0, -4.768370445162873e-07], "top_logprobs": [{"Labour": -0.004295527469366789, "\u0120has": -0.37884804606437683, "\u0120said": -0.001688008545897901, "\u0120it": -0.00016199229867197573, "\u0120will": -0.006709428504109383, "\u0120not": -0.26967597007751465, "\u0120\"": -0.3767099678516388, "fr": -7.152555099310121e-07, "ustr": 0.0, "ate": 0.0, "\u0120Brexit": -0.3198543190956116, "\"": -0.003418318461626768, "\u0120and": -0.4754377603530884, "\u0120try": -1.0345968008041382, "\u0120to": -1.5497195136049413e-06, "\u0120block": -0.05750978738069534, "\u0120the": 0.0, "\u0120bill": -0.2647852897644043, "\u0120implementing": -0.5964427590370178, "\u0120UK": -0.02762061357498169, "'s": -1.1920922133867862e-06, "\u0120withdrawal": -0.6909729242324829, "\u0120from": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "\u0120EU": -0.17300714552402496, ".\u010a\u010a": -0.0022527810651808977, "###": -0.5551609396934509, "\u0120": -0.07289950549602509, "2": -0.000528076896443963, ".": 0.0, "4": -1.0403703451156616, "3": -4.768370445162873e-07, "5": -0.34126415848731995}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The 36-year-old was visited by an officer in April 2016 about his bail arrangements, which a doctor said could have added to his distress. His body was found in the Menai Strait on 2 May. Mr Lewis was receiving treatment at the hospital's Hergest unit and was later moved to the Cynan ward where he received the visit from the officer. Speaking at the inquest in Caernarfon on Thursday, consultant psychiatrist Dr Olufemi Adebajo said he was \"extremely unhappy\" about the visit. \"I don't think the police should be able to come to the ward without special permission,\" he said. Asked by coroner Nicola Jones whether the conversation with the officer could have added to Mr Lewis' agitation and distress, Dr Adebajo said: \"It's quite possible - even likely\". He said he had known Mr Lewis for more than two years and never considered him to be a suicide risk.

Many US scientists are rushing to copy information onto servers outside the control of the federal government. They are afraid the Trump administration will curb access to climate and other research. The President-elect has blown hot and cold on the issue of climate change, having previously tweeted about global warming being a hoax. On Wednesday, one of his advisers compared scientists who support the mainstream view on global warming to flat-Earthers. \"There was an overwhelming science that the Earth was flat and there was an overwhelming science that we were the centre of the world,\" said Anthony Scaramucci, a member of the Trump transition committee, on CNN. \"We get a lot of things wrong in the scientific community.\" Now at the Co-operative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, Dr Abdalati served as Nasa's chief scientist in 2011, for two years. He says it is too early to tell if this type of rhetoric from the Trump team will be backed up by action against scientists working on climate issues. \"I do think that when it comes to access to federal databases, and information that the taxpayers have paid for, there would have to be a tremendous paradigm shift to actively take steps to make those data unavailable, and I think doing so would be an enormous disservice to the citizens of this country and to the world in general,\" he said via email. \"I do think that the scientific community, educators, members of the private sector who rely on these data in their businesses, and others will need to make clear that continued access to these data, which have been paid for by the taxpayers, allows their full value to be realized and is in everyone's best interest.\" Other researchers are taking a more pessimistic view on the question of data access and are encouraging colleagues and students to make copies. Prof Robert Paterson, from the University of Texas, Austin, says that he learned this the hard way under the administration of George W Bush, another president cool on climate. \"Within a month of coming into office the EPA website went down for three weeks and when it went back up stuff wasn't available anymore,\" Prof Paterson told BBC News. \"If history repeats itself with another administration that is basically a naysayer to climate change science, I would say it would be prudent for folks to do what they can to keep as much as they can on mirror sites.\" Other scientists are concerned about nominations to key government areas such as former Texas governor Rick Perry at Department of Energy (DoE) and Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt at the EPA. Both have heavily criticised the agencies they now lead. Attempts by the Trump transition team at the DoE to obtain a list of all those employees who had worked on climate change have provoked anger as well as fear. \"I was horrified by the report with regard to Department of Energy scientists being named.  We must stand up to that and I have said so. We are all DoE scientists in that regard,\" said Dr Kevin Trenberth who has been a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). \"That is a pretty chilling action by an incoming administration - the rhetoric suggests that revenge is a valid response to people who disagree with you,\" said Prof Robert Paterson, The Energy department has refused to comply with the request and the Trump team has now said the questionnaire was \"not authorised\". Many researchers are worried that the anti-climate tone being struck by the incoming administration will have many serious consequences for scientists trying to do their jobs in real world situations. \"Flooding is a fact of life in Texas and the frequency with which we're seeing it is noticeably increasing,\" said Dr Shannon Van Zandt, at Texas A&M University. \"A lot of the tools that have been developed by Federal agencies have been designed to help communities predict the changes that they're going to see and if that is restricted we would lose the ability to help people understand and incorporate it into the decisions that they're making both at the local level and at the state policy level.\" But some in this field believe that the change of administration is a good moment to review the type of scientific questions that US researchers are asking. Marcel Crok is a Dutch science writer who doesn't support the scientific consensus on climate change. He says that much of the research in the field takes place in an echo chamber and he welcomes the fact that the Trump administration will challenge this. Mr Crok accepts that human emissions of carbon dioxide are warming the planet, but he questions the accepted view on how far and how rapidly temperatures will rise. Mainstream scientists, he says, rely on models that are over sensitive to carbon. He expects this to change under Trump. He said: \"What the field is trying to do is prove that the observational estimates are wrong and that the models are still right, and in my opinion this is exactly the problem. They should be more open minded, they should be open to the idea that the models are wrong!\" \"I hope that under a Trump regime at least there would be more funding, because if the funding agencies ask these kind of questions they can stimulate research in other directions than proving that the models are right all the time.\" The idea that aspects of climate research, supported by a minority, should now gain funding at the expense of the majority view, is dismissed by those in the field. \"It is not all spun, it is not all one side or the other,\" said Prof James White from the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado. \"This is good unbiased information, it would be a real shame if that data is turned off.\" Follow Matt on Twitter and on

Bradbury took part in The Specials reunion tour in 2009. He also headed up a band called JB Allstars. The band's representatives said the drummer died in England but no cause of death was given. In a statement, his family said: \"It is with deepest regret that we have to announce the very sad news that our much loved husband and father John 'Brad' Bradbury passed away on Monday the 28 of December. \"Brad's drumming was the powerhouse behind The Specials and it was seen as a key part to the Two Tone sound. He was much respected in the world of drumming and his style of reggae and ska was seen as genuinely ground-breaking when The Specials first hit the charts in 1979. \"He was an integral part of The Specials reforming in 2008 and toured with them extensively up to the present day. His contribution to the world of music can not be understated and he will much missed by family, friends and fans alike. \"It is the family's sincerest wish that they are allowed the time to remember him privately.\" The news comes three months after the band's trombonist, Rico Rodriguez, died. The band, famed for their 1960s mod-style outfits, had seven UK top 10 singles including Too Much Too Young and Ghost Town.

Cole has improved physically and has lost most of the weight he gained through his illness. And while there is still more work to do, Cole, who will be United's assistant manager for the return legends game against Barcelona at Old Trafford on 2 September, is looking forward to playing if a similar match is staged in 2018.

YouTube has denied claims that the authorities can filter content. Many young Pakistanis have welcomed the lifting of the ban but some activists want details of the deal with Google. They say there should be greater transparency of the terms agreed between Google and the government. A Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) official confirmed to the BBC that all internet service providers had been directed to open access to YouTube. The Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd posted on its Facebook page on Monday: \"Welcome Back YouTube\". Pakistan's ministry of information technology said: \"Google has provided an online web process through which requests for blocking access of offending material can be made by the PTA to Google directly. \"Google/YouTube will accordingly restrict access to the said offending material for users within Pakistan.\" However, a YouTube spokeswoman said government requests for the removal of content would not automatically be granted. \"We have clear community guidelines, and when videos violate those rules, we remove them,\" she said. \"In addition, where we have launched YouTube locally and we are notified that a video is illegal in that country, we may restrict access to it after a thorough review.\" She said requests by governments for content to be removed would be recorded in YouTube's Transparency Report. Pakistan's ban on YouTube was imposed by the Supreme Court in 2012 after the US-made film Innocence of Muslims was uploaded. The amateur-made video was condemned in the Muslim world and sparked widespread protests for its mocking portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad. More than a dozen people died in protests in Pakistan. Blasphemy is a crime in Pakistan and can carry the death penalty, although such a sentence has not been carried out.

Media playback is not supported on this device \"We've been in situations like that before when we've been so close and have lost so to pull it off now is unbelievable.\" He had previously won silver medals at the 2015 and 2016 World Championship - this year to the Australian team - but Doull earned Olympic redemption to add to the four Welsh silver medallists in Rio. \"I've dreamt of this moment for so long,\" added Doull. \"It's what gets you out of the bed in the morning. I've pictured crossing that line first and winning the Olympics and to finally be here and do it, it's just surreal. It's a culmination of four years of hard work.\" Swimmer Jazz Carlin, rower Victoria Thornley and rugby sevens players Sam Cross and James Davies had already enjoyed podium finishes before Doull secured Wales' seventh gold in the last three Olympics. Wales had not won an Olympic title in 36 years when Nicole Cooke stormed to women's road race gold in 2008 - the first Welsh cycling medal ever at an Olympics. But since Cooke's win in Beijing, Wales have won three more cycling gold medals - and could win a fifth on Saturday when Elinor Barker will help the British world record holding women bid for team pursuit gold. Doull - who started cycling at the Maindy Fliers club in Cardiff like Thomas and Barker - had helped the Great Britain team to lower the world record in their heat demolition of New Zealand. But Team GB were quickly behind in Friday's final as Australia led by 0.7 seconds at the halfway mark, before GB reeled them in and then pulled away in the final 500m to win the 4km race by 0.83 seconds - in a world record time of three minutes, 50.265 seconds. Doull's team-mate Wiggins became the first Briton to win eight Olympic medals - five golds, one silver and two bronzes - as GB won a third successive team pursuit Olympic title. \"It gives you such confidence....you've got Brad on my right behind me and I've got Burke and Ed down below me,\" said Doull. \"It's Burke's second Olympic title in his discipline, it's Ed's third and he's the most decorated Yorkshireman, so he keeps telling me, so to have that calibre of team is just massive and it gives you such confidence.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Owain Doull has won Wales' first gold of the 2016 Olympics as  he helped the Great Britain men's team pursuit defend their cycling title in Rio.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "Welshman Owain Doull helped Great Britain win team pursuit gold at the Rio Olympics, emulating fellow Welshman Sir Bradley Wiggins.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["Wel", "sh", "man", "\u0120Ow", "ain", "\u0120Dou", "ll", "\u0120helped", "\u0120Great", "\u0120Britain", "\u0120win", "\u0120team", "\u0120pursuit", "\u0120gold", "\u0120at", "\u0120the", "\u0120Rio", "\u0120Olympics", ",", "\u0120em", "ulating", "\u0120fellow", "\u0120Welsh", "man", "\u0120Sir", "\u0120Bradley", "\u0120W", "iggins", ".\u010a\u010a", "###\u010a", "Article", ":", "\u0120The", "\u0120", "25", "-year", "-old", ",", "\u0120who", "\u0120is", "\u0120in", "\u0120her", "\u0120second", "\u0120year", "\u0120at", "\u0120the", "\u0120University", "\u0120of", "\u0120Leeds", ",", "\u0120was", "\u0120found", "\u0120dead", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120city", "'s", "\u0120Hyde", "\u0120Park", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120early", "\u0120hours", "\u0120of"], "token_logprobs": [-0.18722346425056458, 0.0, -0.43245530128479004, -1.1920858014491387e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.46182090044021606, -0.6064859628677368, 0.0, -0.619748055934906, -0.36998870968818665, 0.0, -7.152555099310121e-07, -0.1862194836139679, -0.09163712710142136, -0.002976037794724107, -0.0003077510336879641, -0.07261408120393753, -1.9311717551317997e-05, 0.0, -0.7667340040206909, -0.040318746119737625, -0.00019536493346095085, -0.35003432631492615, -0.00012861855793744326, 0.0, 0.0, -0.01014233659952879, -0.33067309856414795, -0.00036006642039865255, 0.0, -0.09566743671894073, -0.005865741521120071, -1.7747704982757568, -4.768370445162873e-07, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.19417724013328552, -0.240617036819458, -0.6213611364364624, -0.36819860339164734, -0.7441279888153076, -0.03062472492456436, -0.382214218378067, -0.9120855331420898, -0.001799156074412167, -0.05670520290732384, -8.344646857949556e-07, -0.8823025822639465, -2.3841855067985307e-07, -0.17210079729557037, -0.07655281573534012, -0.01984257809817791, -0.5640510320663452, -0.20983555912971497, -0.82930588722229, -0.5262413024902344, -0.01868574135005474, 0.0, -0.00833154283463955, -0.0048079355619847775, 0.0, 0.0, -2.3841855067985307e-07], "top_logprobs": [{"Wel": -0.18722346425056458, "sh": 0.0, "man": -0.00019536493346095085, "\u0120Ow": -1.1920858014491387e-05, "ain": 0.0, "\u0120Dou": 0.0, "ll": 0.0, "\u0120helped": -0.46182090044021606, "\u0120Great": -0.6064859628677368, "\u0120Britain": 0.0, "\u0120win": -0.619748055934906, "\u0120team": -0.36998870968818665, "\u0120pursuit": 0.0, "\u0120gold": -7.152555099310121e-07, "\u0120at": -0.9120855331420898, "\u0120the": -0.0048079355619847775, "\u0120Rio": -0.002976037794724107, "\u0120Olympics": -0.0003077510336879641, ",": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "\u0120em": -1.9311717551317997e-05, "ulating": 0.0, "\u0120fellow": -0.7667340040206909, "\u0120Welsh": -0.040318746119737625, "\u0120Sir": -0.35003432631492615, "\u0120Bradley": -0.00012861855793744326, "\u0120W": 0.0, "iggins": 0.0, ".\u010a\u010a": -0.01014233659952879, "###\u010a": -0.33067309856414795, "Article": -0.00036006642039865255, ":": 0.0, "\u0120The": -0.09566743671894073, "\u0120": -0.005865741521120071, "25": -1.7747704982757568, "-year": -4.768370445162873e-07, "-old": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "\u0120who": -0.240617036819458, "\u0120is": -0.6213611364364624, "\u0120in": -0.00833154283463955, "\u0120her": -0.7441279888153076, "\u0120second": -0.03062472492456436, "\u0120year": -0.382214218378067, "\u0120University": -0.05670520290732384, "\u0120of": -2.3841855067985307e-07, "\u0120Leeds": -0.8823025822639465, "\u0120was": -0.17210079729557037, "\u0120found": -0.07655281573534012, "\u0120dead": -0.01984257809817791, "\u0120city": -0.82930588722229, "'s": -0.5262413024902344, "\u0120Hyde": -0.01868574135005474, "\u0120Park": 0.0, "\u0120early": 0.0, "\u0120hours": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Bridget and Jonathan Reid, from Moy, near Tomatin in the Highlands, tied the knot at Nevis Range, near Fort William, on Friday. The couple first's date six years ago was a skiing trip, so they decided it would be appropriate to get married on skis. Adventure photographer Hamish Frost took their wedding snaps. Bridget, who is a teacher, and Jonathan, who runs his own electrical automation company, benefited from recent snowfalls for their big day. They got married in full Highland dress, which includes a kilt, and white wedding dress surrounded by snow-covered mountain landscape. The white stuff had been lacking over winter, but last month's Storm Doris and recent spells of colder weather have helped with the operation of Nevis Range and Scotland's other outdoor ski centres. The newly weds said: \"Over the last couple of years we have spent as many weekends as possible skiing the Back Corries at Nevis Range. \"We love the atmosphere, the friendliness of the staff and the amazing terrain for skiing.  When we heard that we could actually get married there it was a no-brainer.\" The couple got married at the top of Easy Gully in a ceremony officiated by Halde Pottinger from the Humanist Society of Scotland. \"He was totally up for marrying us on skis and did an amazing job. He is currently trying to establish whether or not we are the first wedding actually conducted and vowed in skis - officiate and couple,\" said the Reids. \"We can't actually believe we are but there can't be many. We also managed to twist the arm of adventure photographer Hamish Frost, who came along to take photographs.\" The couple added: \"The day could not have been better. Without doubt it was the best conditions of the year - with blue skies and fresh snow, we could not have asked for more.\" They thanked the staff of Nevis Range for \"a fabulous job making our day possible\", and for helping in throwing \"a hell of a good party\" in the evening.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "All images copyrighted.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "A couple who got married on skis at a Scottish ski resort slid down a slope in their wedding attire.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["A", "\u0120couple", "\u0120who", "\u0120got", "\u0120married", "\u0120on", "\u0120sk", "is", "\u0120at", "\u0120a", "\u0120Scottish", "\u0120ski", "\u0120resort", "\u0120slid", "\u0120down", "\u0120a", "\u0120slope", "\u0120in", "\u0120their", "\u0120wedding", "\u0120attire", ".\u010a\u010a", "###\u010a", "Article", ":", "\u0120The", "\u0120", "201", "6", "-", "17", "\u0120season", "\u0120will", "\u0120be", "\u0120the", "\u0120last", "\u0120for", "\u0120the", "\u0120", "31", "-year", "-old", ",", "\u0120who", "\u0120has", "\u0120won", "\u0120", "14", "\u0120Grand", "\u0120Slam", "\u0120titles", ".", "\u0120\"", "I", "\u0120have", "\u0120been", "\u0120blessed", "\u0120to", "\u0120play", "\u0120in", "\u0120an", "\u0120era", "\u0120with", "\u0120some"], "token_logprobs": [-0.013310973532497883, -0.0025106121320277452, -0.5830163359642029, -0.3146689832210541, 0.0, -0.03189728409051895, -0.004602909088134766, 0.0, -0.06678887456655502, -0.0009504806366749108, -0.0050782738253474236, -0.03485267609357834, -0.667465090751648, -0.2012934535741806, -0.006734531372785568, -0.18147048354148865, -0.24286434054374695, -0.006821440067142248, -0.00037019551382400095, -0.00030763185350224376, -0.06035250797867775, -0.006298454012721777, -0.41110342741012573, -5.960462772236497e-07, -8.22540732769994e-06, -0.5848511457443237, -0.05679384618997574, -2.032081365585327, -0.4942066967487335, -0.9565448760986328, -0.0070731244049966335, -0.1951572746038437, -0.8026673197746277, -0.018711833283305168, -0.00040391870425082743, -0.5046619176864624, -0.003287270897999406, -1.1205610462639015e-05, -0.003543647238984704, -2.5101675987243652, -4.768370445162873e-07, -5.960462772236497e-07, -0.004252320621162653, -6.97350042173639e-05, -0.019309287890791893, -0.1674218475818634, -0.026059944182634354, -0.2958983778953552, -0.7837786674499512, -0.01620408520102501, -0.3454020321369171, -0.3680012822151184, -0.5578495264053345, -0.026795903220772743, -0.6950090527534485, -0.33214640617370605, -0.5419003963470459, -0.2299114316701889, -0.3777206242084503, -0.050818026065826416, -0.39404529333114624, 0.0, -1.0132738680113107e-05, -0.0057494742795825005], "top_logprobs": [{"A": -0.013310973532497883, "\u0120couple": -0.0025106121320277452, "\u0120who": -6.97350042173639e-05, "\u0120got": -0.3146689832210541, "\u0120married": 0.0, "\u0120on": -0.03189728409051895, "\u0120sk": -0.004602909088134766, "is": 0.0, "\u0120at": -0.06678887456655502, "\u0120a": -0.18147048354148865, "\u0120Scottish": -0.0050782738253474236, "\u0120ski": -0.03485267609357834, "\u0120resort": -0.667465090751648, "\u0120slid": -0.2012934535741806, "\u0120down": -0.006734531372785568, "\u0120slope": -0.24286434054374695, "\u0120in": -0.050818026065826416, "\u0120their": -0.00037019551382400095, "\u0120wedding": -0.00030763185350224376, "\u0120attire": -0.06035250797867775, ".\u010a\u010a": -0.006298454012721777, "###\u010a": -0.41110342741012573, "Article": -5.960462772236497e-07, ":": -8.22540732769994e-06, "\u0120The": -0.5848511457443237, "\u0120": -0.026059944182634354, "201": -2.032081365585327, "6": -0.4942066967487335, "-": -0.9565448760986328, "17": -0.0070731244049966335, "\u0120season": -0.1951572746038437, "\u0120will": -0.8026673197746277, "\u0120be": -0.018711833283305168, "\u0120the": -1.1205610462639015e-05, "\u0120last": -0.5046619176864624, "\u0120for": -0.003287270897999406, "31": -2.5101675987243652, "-year": -4.768370445162873e-07, "-old": -5.960462772236497e-07, ",": -0.004252320621162653, "\u0120has": -0.019309287890791893, "\u0120won": -0.1674218475818634, "14": -0.2958983778953552, "\u0120Grand": -0.7837786674499512, "\u0120Slam": -0.01620408520102501, "\u0120titles": -0.3454020321369171, ".": -0.3680012822151184, "\u0120\"": -0.5578495264053345, "I": -0.026795903220772743, "\u0120have": -0.6950090527534485, "\u0120been": -0.33214640617370605, "\u0120blessed": -0.5419003963470459, "\u0120to": -0.2299114316701889, "\u0120play": -0.3777206242084503, "\u0120an": -0.39404529333114624, "\u0120era": 0.0, "\u0120with": -1.0132738680113107e-05, "\u0120some": -0.0057494742795825005}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

She was sentenced to 50 months in prison after being caught falsifying records of emerging markets trades. Hong Kong regulators said RBS's controls were \"seriously inadequate\". The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) also said there were \"significant weaknesses in its procedures, management systems and internal controls.\" But the regulator said the fine took into account the bank's speedy action in alerting the authorities once it had discovered the illegal trades, which took place in its emerging markets rates business in 2011. \"This deserves substantial credit and is the reason why today's sanctions are not heavier ones,\" Mark Steward, the SFC's head of enforcement, said in a statement. RBS responded with a statement, reading: \"We put in place a comprehensive remediation programme that strengthened our governance and supervisory oversight, and our control environment.\" The fine is relatively small compared to others the bank has received in the last few years.

The firm admitted a Health and Safety Executive (HSE) breach and was fined \u00c2\u00a37,500. It must also pay \u00c2\u00a31,120 costs.

Aurora Borealis occurs when electrically-charged particles from the sun enter the earth's atmosphere. Many people took to social media to share photographs of the dramatic show. Forecasters had predicted a solar storm and good conditions for Aurora Borealis, and sightings of green, pink, purple, red and yellow lights were reported for several hours from about 20:00 GMT. Gavin Chambers, an RSPB warden, tweeted pictures of vivid green in the sky over Lake Vyrnwy in Powys, Wales, saying: \"Well worth getting back out of bed for!!\" Donna Butcher tweeted: \"Just been watching an amazing display of Aurora from Staveley, Cumbria.

Sir Patrick presented the first edition of The Sky at Night on 24 April 1957. He became famous for his habit of wearing a monocle on screen, as well as his dishevelled and idiosyncratic persona. However, he was a celebrated and gifted astronomer and wrote dozens of books, with his research being used by the US and the Soviet Union in their space programmes.

Rescuers found Sophia and Poppy 200m from a dam on the family's property. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: Here are the best bits we heard backstage at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In La La Land, Emma Stone plays aspiring actress Mia Dolan. So does the best actress winner think Mia could ever win a Bafta or Oscar? After a dramatic pause, she delivered her verdict. \"Hopefully!\" \"It's been like a whirlwind,\" said Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, winner of the Rising Star Award. \"I'm so happy everything seems to be working out.\" The 20-year-old Brit isn't wrong there. Having made his screen debut in tsunami disaster movie The Impossible, he first appeared as Spidey in Captain America: Civil War and recently finished filming for Spider-Man: Homecoming. But Tom admitted the super hero role has its drawbacks. \"Ever since I was a kid I've wanted to be Spider-Man. It's been so fun, but my legs are in bits right now from spider poses after spider poses. \"So I'll be sitting down for the rest of the evening!\" It was perhaps inevitable that Meryl Streep's speech at the Golden Globes would come up at the Baftas. Asked about Donald Trump's response, supporting actress winner Viola Davis didn't hold back. \"Anyone who labels Meryl Streep an 'overrated' actress obviously doesn't know anything about acting,\" she said. \"That's not just directed towards Donald Trump - that's directed towards anyone.\" She didn't stop there. \"This is someone who is the master at her skill and she has lasted for 40 years in a very difficult profession,\" Viola continued. \"One of the things people have to know about this woman is that she is the most honourable, accessible human being you could possibly want to meet.\" Best actor winner Casey Affleck said he'd grabbed a word with Meryl Streep after the Baftas ceremony. \"She was taking pictures of people... and I told her how much her speech at the Golden Globes meant to all of us and how grateful I was that she did it and kicked in the door a little bit,\" he said. The Manchester by the Sea star said he hoped more actors would speak out. \"There is a big audience for these awards shows... and I have to say I'm very proud to be a part of the arts community. \"I don't always say some of the things I would like to say in those opportunities because there are people like Meryl Streep who say them much better than I can - and if they are going to be said it should be said very, very well because they are important.\" \"I'm a little bit wobbly,\" confessed Dev Patel a few minutes after winning the supporting actor prize for Lion. \"I really did not expect it, we have gone to so many awards ceremony and this one is where everything changed, on home turf with my family.\" Dev recalled how he had made his acting debut a decade ago on E4's teen drama Skins. \"I remember the first time I ever stepped on a film set, I never knew what a boom mic was,\" he laughed. \"My mum took me to an open casting of Skins after she saw an advert in Metro newspaper and 10 years on we are here at the Baftas - that is pretty amazing.\" Justin Hurwitz, who won the Bafta for his original music in La La Land, said that he'd written a title song that didn't end up in the movie. \"It was going to be in the middle of the movie but we nixed that, and then we toyed with using it in the end credits, and we nixed that at the last minute.\" And how about this? Another Day of Sun, from the famous traffic jam scene, was cut \"for many months\" before being put back in as the big opening number. Mel Brooks, who was awarded the prestigious Bafta Fellowship, was asked about whether he might write a comedy about Donald Trump. \"I'm not afraid of him, I don't think he's dangerous,\" said the 90-year-old writer, actor and producer. \"I think he's mostly an entertainer, a guy who wants audiences to love him. \"What I'm afraid of are all the guys around him, the people who whisper in his ears, like the people who whispered in George W Bush's ears and we got the Iraq War... \"I just hope that Trump stays the egomaniac he is, listens to no-one and then we'll all be safe.

Winning his last five tournaments of 2016 to pip Novak Djokovic to the year-end number one position in the final match of the season at London's O2 Arena was astonishing, dramatic and unforgettable. And yet it appears that relentless run of success, and the 87 matches he played over a season, has come at a price. Murray's straight-set defeat by world number 90 Jordan Thompson in the first round at Queen's Club was the sixth time he has lost to a player outside the top 20 this year. He has had shingles and an elbow problem, and now his left hip is proving cause for concern. Opting out of two scheduled exhibition matches at the Hurlingham Club in London may not be too much of a blow, as Murray's aptitude for grass is likely to allow him some margin for error during the opening week at Wimbledon. But will he be in pain, and will his movement suffer? Although it was reassuring to see him return to the practice courts on Friday, Murray was walking with a limp and neither moving, nor hitting his backhand, anywhere near as well as he will need to. Only time will tell. Media playback is not supported on this device Murray has looked especially vulnerable this season over three sets. As well as the defeat by Thompson at Queen's, he has also lost in straight sets to Fabio Fognini in Rome (no disgrace), to Borna Coric in Madrid, and to world number 129 Vasek Pospisil at Indian Wells. Though he was bamboozled by Mischa Zverev in the fourth round of the Australian Open, his Grand Slam record remains formidable. He is aiming this fortnight for a 10th consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final, and the last time he failed to reach the second week of a Slam was when he fell to Stan Wawrinka in the third round of the 2010 US Open. So, assuming Murray's hip does not leave him underpowered, the French Open provides the best indication as to how he might fare at Wimbledon. Murray often started slowly in matches at Roland Garros, but put in a dominant third-round performance against Juan Martin del Potro as he won in straight sets. He never looked a realistic champion, but ultimately was just a tie-break away from a second consecutive final. He then ran out of steam, a legacy of insufficient matches, in a Stan Wawrinka-dominated final set of their semi-final. It would be foolish to try to come to a firm conclusion about Murray's chances at the All England Club this year. Twice a champion, and a gold-medal winner on Centre Court at the 2012 Olympics, not even Novak Djokovic has outperformed him at Wimbledon over the past five years. Yet on 2017 results alone, Murray is only the seventh best player in the field. He has too frequently struggled to impose himself on his opponent, and hindered at times by injury, has not been able to trust his serve in the same way. This year he has won 72% of points on first serve, down from 76% last year; and while last year he saved 66% of the break points he faced, that number has fallen this year to 54%. He claims his indifferent form is nothing to do with the pressure associated with his status as world number one, and he does not cut the figure of a man weighed down by an unwelcome burden. But perhaps Murray has lost his cause: he is now the hunted, rather than the hunter. That may not be a concern much longer. Murray is virtually 5,000 points behind Rafael Nadal in the season-long race and is therefore very likely to be replaced at the top of the rankings by the autumn at the latest. In fact, he could be overtaken after Wimbledon by Wawrinka or Djokovic if they win the title, but more probably by Nadal, who assuming both reach the second week would only have to go one round further. Nadal's knees, Djokovic's blues and Wawrinka's unexceptional Wimbledon record muddy the waters still further. And then there's Roger Federer: the seven-time champion, who is free of injuries, and last Sunday in Halle won his fourth title of the year having skipped the clay-court season.

Just Racing ceased trading on Friday, effectively ending the Manor team. The staff were sent home on Friday and told they will be made redundant by the close of business on Tuesday after the payment of January salaries. FRP said there was \"no sustainable operational or financial structure in place to maintain the group as a going concern\". Joint administrator Geoff Rowley added the administration process \"provided a moratorium\" in the search for a buyer but \"no solution could be achieved to allow for the business to continue in its current form\". It is not necessarily the end of Manor - a buyer could potentially still purchase the remnants of the team. But even if that were to happen, the move makes it much harder for Manor to make it to the start of the season in Australia on 26 March. The team's collapse leaves 10 teams - 20 cars - on the grid in Melbourne and comes just five days after the sport was taken over by US company Liberty Media and long-time commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone was removed as chief executive. Media playback is not supported on this device Manor started life as Virgin Racing in 2010 and has been through several guises in the intervening seven years. It previously went into administration in October 2014, and was only saved by current owner Stephen Fitzpatrick, the boss of energy firm Ovo, on the eve of the 2015 season. Fitzpatrick has said the decisive moment was the team's slip to 11th place in the constructors' championship as a result of Sauber's Felipe Nasr finishing ninth in the penultimate race of last season in Brazil. This cost the team in the region of $15m (\u00a312m) in prize money. Manor were one of three new teams to enter F1 in 2010 after they were promised by then FIA president Max Mosley that a \u00a340m budget cap would be introduced. But Mosley stood down as head of the governing body in 2009 after losing a fight with the teams over the plan and the cost limit was abandoned. All three teams have now collapsed. This content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and cookies are enabled or update your browser Anneliese Dodds MEP has called for a European Commission investigation into the FIA and F1 following Manor's collapse. She said: \"The collapse of Manor Racing could be the end of seven turbulent years for a team that brought highly skilled jobs to Oxfordshire. I am very concerned that this follows other job losses in small teams. \"Formula One Group, its owners and the FIA as a regulator really need to be investigated after this collapse. \"The unfair way in which prize money is allocated in the sport, permanently favouring the largest teams regardless of their finishing position, has seen many teams struggle to survive and ultimately reduced the number of cars on the grid. \"The European Commission must investigate the complaints it received last year from two F1 teams related to anti-competitive practices before even more highly skilled jobs are lost both in the South East and all around Europe. \"I will be writing to the Commission to call on them to take serious action on the way F1 is run, before a sport loved by 500 million fans is damaged beyond repair.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The Manor team have collapsed after administrators failed to find a buyer for the stricken business.",
